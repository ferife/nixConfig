# Basics of Neovim, its Documentation, and This Configuration

## Documentation

Whenever the documentation lists `<C-x>` as a keyboard input (replacing `x` with any character), that means to press CTRL+`x`

Whenever the documentation lists `<CR>` as a keyboard input, that means to press the Enter key

Whenever the documentation lists `<M-x>` as a keyboard input (replacing `x` with any character), that means to press Alt+`x`
`M` stands for Meta, so if the meta key changes, these inputs change
