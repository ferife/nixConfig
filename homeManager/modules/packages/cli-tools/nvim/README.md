# Introduction

This is a repository made for me to learn about Neovim and create a custom Neovim config for myself

I do not intend for anyone else to use thsi, but I can't/won't stop you

I made this remote repo to have a secure remote place to keep my config and to keep track of the changes

I made it a public repo to show off that ***I use Neovim btw*** lol

But seriously, I did it to show off (mostly to prospective employers) that I am willing and able to learn to use all sorts of different tools.

Yes, I did copy/paste half of this from my nixConfig README

# To-Do List
